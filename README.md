In this project, the programming language used is dart. It is a mobile application for blinds, so that they can easily detect objects coming infront of them. That is why it is termed as "Smart Eye for blinds". In this project the mobile camera is used as a sensor, which with the help of tensorflow dataset detects the objects that are trained in the dataset and then the text coming on the screen is converted into speech.
